# Rain-alert
a simple program that uses Open weather map current weather API and the Twilio sms API to send messages to the user when its bound to rain.
the rain condition is based on OWM weather condition codes so anything less 700 means rain or snow.
i hosted this on pythonanywhere.com where it will run every day on their servers and send a text if its going to rain in my location.
it was fun, mainly because i got to learn more about API's and also dealing with environment variables.
